Array:
An array is one of the most basic data structures in Java. It is a fixed-size container used to store elements of the same data type. The length of the array is determined when it is created and cannot be changed later.
ArrayList:
ArrayList is a dynamic array class provided by Java. It can automatically expand as the amount of data increases and belongs to the Java Collections Framework. Its underlying layer is actually implemented with arrays.
Arrays store data directly, while ArrayList stores objects internally through wrapper classes. In other words, ArrayList requires boxing and unboxing, which will have a certain performance overhead.
Array: Once the array size is initialized, it cannot be changed. If more storage space is needed, a larger array must be recreated and the original data must be copied over.
ArrayList: The size changes dynamically, and it will automatically expand as needed, without the need for developers to manage it manually.
Performance comparison
• Arrays have higher performance: Arrays have higher performance when accessing and operating because they directly operate on elements in memory without additional overhead.
• ArrayList is flexible but slightly slower: ArrayList operations require frequent boxing and unboxing, especially when expanding capacity, it needs to create a new array and copy the data over, which will affect performance.
Supported operations
Array:
Arrays are relatively "primitive" data structures that support index access, but do not support addition and deletion operations.
Multithreading support
• Array: The array itself is thread-safe because it is the most basic data structure and has no additional thread synchronization mechanism.
• ArrayList: ArrayList is not thread-safe. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you can wrap it with Collections.synchronizedList(), or directly use the thread-safe CopyOnWriteArrayList.
Choices in real scenarios
In actual development, how do we choose?
• Scenarios that require high performance and fixed size: Arrays are preferred, such as processing large amounts of mathematical calculations or memory-sensitive tasks.
• Flexible operations or dynamic expansion are required: ArrayList is a better choice, such as storing user-entered data or dynamically generated data.
